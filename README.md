# JS-image-games
Three simple JS games to use on website

Games are made as angular directives
they are fairly easy to implement although it's necessary to include angular touch in order for it to work.

Games:
- Memory;
- Simple switch puzzle;
- Switch puzzle with one piece missing;

Games are scallable, they also work with touch / swipe motion;

They can be adapted using different images, icons. As an brand promotion or just plain fun!

Styling done with help of Sebastian Nagraba :)
