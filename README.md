# JS-image-games
Three simple JS games to use on website

Games are made as angular directives
they are fairly easy to implement although it's necessary to include angular touch in order for it to work.

Games:
- Memory
- Simple switch puzzle;
- Switch puzzle with one piece missing;


Styling done with help of Sebastian Nagraba :)
